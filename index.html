    <h2>Welcome to the STARDUST project!</h2>
    <p>This is a research project funded by the UKRI Medical Research Council and taking place in the Virtual Reality Research Facility at the University of Manchester. We are investigating the motion perception of people with Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD).</p>
    <p>We are still looking for participants both with and without PPPD, so take a look around and get in touch if you are interested in the project.</p>
