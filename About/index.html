    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>
        STARDUST is a research project at the University of Manchester, investigating the motion perception of people with Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD).
        The project started in February 2024 at the Virtual Reality Research (VR2) Facility, where we are able to measure motion perception with equipment including eye trackers, Head Mounted Displays, and a 6 degrees-of-freedom motion platform.
        We are roughly halfway through data collection, with plenty more opportunities for participants to join the project, so please get in touch if you are interested!

    <h2>About our Research Team</h2>
    <p>
        Headed by Dr Paul Warren, our research team consists of 6 research staff, 5 clinicians and 2 patient collaborators.
        The research staff deal with the day-to-day running of the project, ensuring that the experiments work correctly and data collection goes smoothly;
        some of the clincians are involved in recruitment, with each patient participant screened for PPPD before being accepted as a participant;
        and the patient collaborators have been key in ensuring that the experiments are comfortable for people with PPPD to participate in, while giving incredible insights into the disorder and how it presents in different people.
