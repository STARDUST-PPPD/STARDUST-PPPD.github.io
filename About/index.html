    <h2>About our Project</h2>
    <p>
        STARDUST is an <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/" target="_blank" class="textlink">MRC (UKRI Medical Research Council)</a> funded 
        research project at the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" class="textlink">University of Manchester</a>, aiming to 
        better understand the motion perception of people with Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD).
    </p>
    <p>
        The project started in February 2024 at the <a href="https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/VR2/" target="_blank" class="textlink">Virtual Reality 
        Research (VR2) Facility</a>, where we are able to measure motion perception with equipment including eye and body tracking tech, VR headsets, 
        and a motion platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are just over halfway through data collection, with plenty more opportunities for participants to join the project, so please 
        <a href="/Contact/" class="textlink">get in touch</a> if you are interested!
    </p>
    <h2>About our Research Team</h2>
    <p>
        Headed by Dr Paul Warren, our research team consists of 6 research staff, 5 clinicians and 2 patient collaborators.
    </p>
    <p>
        The research staff deal with the day-to-day running of the project, ensuring that the experiments work correctly and data collection goes smoothly;
        some of the clincians are involved in recruitment, with each patient participant screened for PPPD before being accepted as a participant;
        and the patient collaborators have been key in ensuring that the experiments are comfortable for people with PPPD to participate in, while 
        giving incredible insights into the disorder and how it presents in different people.
    </p>
    <h2>About our Recruitment</h2>
    <p>
        We are working closely with 4 NHS Trusts (<a href="https://mft.nhs.uk/" target="_blank" class="textlink">Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.northerncarealliance.nhs.uk/" target="_blank" class="textlink">Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.guysandstthomas.nhs.uk/" target="_blank" class="textlink">Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.nhslothian.scot/" target="_blank" class="textlink">NHS Lothian</a>), with a lot of our recruitment coming from referrals from clinical 
        staff. Each patient participant is screened for PPPD by a clinician from one of these trusts before being accepted as a participant.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are also working closely with the <a href="https://www.meandve.org.uk/" target="_blank" class="textlink">Ménière's Society</a>, who have included some 
        information about our project in their <a href="https://www.meandve.org.uk/magazine" class="textlink">Mé&Ve (previously SPIN) magazine</a> and on the 
        <a href="https://www.meandve.org.uk/research/studies-recruiting-participants" target="_blank" class="textlink">recruiting page</a> of their website.
    </p>
    <h2>About our Lab</h2>
    <p>
        In the <a href="https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/VR2/" target="_blank" class="textlink">VR2 Facility</a>, we are equipped with Head Mounted Displays including 
        the Meta Quest 3, which we use for the majority of our stimulus presentation, alongside a 6 Degrees-of-Freedom motion platform manufactured 
        by <a href="https://www.deltakinetic.com/" target="_blank" class="textlink">Delta Kinetic</a>, <a href="https://optitrack.com/" target="_blank" class="textlink">OptiTrack</a> 
        motion tracking cameras, and more. We are able to call upon the expertise of a dedicated hardware engineer and a dedicated software engineer 
        to ensure that the equipment and codes are in working order. This expertise has been invaluable for this project along with many others.
